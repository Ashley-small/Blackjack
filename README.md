# Blackjack

This is a blackjack app made using js, html and css. Majority of this app is made using arrays and loops. 

I would like to rebuild this with react and then add more functionality so that once you receive your initial card values, a physical card slides across the screen so you can fully visualise it. 
I am assuming that I would have to assign each card value to the number and use if and else functionality and style.display to create the visual effects.
